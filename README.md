## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of functional fMRI data to investigate brain activity related to semantic memory. The goal is to visualize and understand which brain regions are activated during tasks involving semantic memory using neuroimaging data.

## Data Used
The dataset for this project includes functional and anatomical fMRI images. These files are stored in the project directory and are loaded using Python's `glob` and `nilearn` libraries.

## Notebook Files
- **main_notebook.ipynb**: This is the Jupyter notebook used for analyzing the data, visualizing the brain regions, and plotting histograms.

## Python Packages Used
Python 3.12.4 was used for this project. Additionally, the following libraries were used:
- `nilearn`: For loading and visualizing MRI data.
- `nibabel`: For reading MRI file formats.
- `glob`: For searching and loading files from directories.
- `numpy`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting histograms and visualizations.
